Walter from Easy Does it. The treasurer of Easy Does It. Might be concerned about maintainability.
John Benson from Easy Does it. Direct service provider/attendant. Helps fix wheelchairs. DME Durable Medical Equipment

## History
Founded in 1994 by people with disabilities. Funded through the 1998 Measure E bill in the city of Berkeley. Takes
a bit from the property tax.
They are the only service like this in the world. 

## Attendant Services
Client calls for attendant service if, for example, one of their normal attendants cannot make it. 
Should be for urgently needed services.
1. Need help getting out of bed
2. Need assistance in bathroom.
3. Need help making dinner
4. Going to the store for an urgent need (diabetic w/ food need) 
5. Pick people up from doctors' appointments.
6. Can take someone up to one mile outside Berkeley city limits or anywhere in Berkeley.
Example: Nonverbal cerebral palsy patient's wheelchair broke on campus--front wheel fell off.

They give their contact info to the dispatcher. 
Try to provide service w/in 45 minutes of being called.
Most clients nowadays have smart phones, but a significant portion do NOT. Also, they're doing more outreach to the elderly,
	who often don't have much experience with smart phones or devices.
Others have communication boards. Ask more about this later...
Problems:
1. Some patients have a lot of trouble using the telephone.
2. Emergency services being called are very expensive to the taxpayer compared to calling this group.

## Questions:
1. How do clients who are nonverbal communicate what they need to you? Grunt once for yes, twice for no, 
   knowing the clients.
2. How many repairs per day? (6-7)
3. How many attendants? (~20s)
4. How many clients? 500.
5. How often are new people being registered? Regularly... But maybe 1 a week, up to 5 or 6.
6. How do you work with the kin of your clients? Sometimes the kin contacts Easy Does It. 
	Independent living movement, trying to be apart from.
7. Existing DB system?
	Web based version of filemaker. They wouldn't want to lose the data that they have. The database maybe needs to be cleaned up.
	Currently the DB can be used to help  people who have, say, electrical needs during the power outage. They have a lot
		of data on this but it isn't easily accessible.
8. More about efficiency or meeting needs that they're having trouble meeting?
	A lot of time is wasted trying to collect data to present to the government rather than helping clients.
	Goal of getting funding more easily by being able to present data in effective ways to govt.
	Expanding clientele. Aging population and attempt to reach out to seniors. (Mb working with hospitals?)
	Ways of effectively disseminating information between members of the staff.
9. Normally 2 to 4 attendants on duty at a given time.
10. Where's the bottleneck? Not enough attendants. There are BURSTY requests to the dispatcher, however. Electric wheelchair stuck in 
	the rain...
11. TOP 3 FEATURES:
	Answer 1
	Simplified user interface usable by people with many disabilities.
	Data integration and ease of collecting data.
	Answer 2
	Easy to use administrative side. App for the attendant, app for the dispatcher, app for the user.
	Answer 3
	Improvement of the communication flow  client -> dispatcher -> attendant. (All 3 using their smartphones for the app, ideally)
	Logging of this communication flow in a database.
	Information flow when a new dispatcher comes in. They should get the old dispatcher's information. LOG IT ALLLLLLL!!!!

Individual Questions I'd like to ask:
	

EVERYTHING IS DONE THROUGH A DISPATCHER ---> Major pain point and the bottleneck of the whole process.

Ideally a design solution would be easy to change to meet an equivalent company's needs. Not too tailored maybe?
## Dispatcher
Asks client whether they want a male or female attendant to help them or if they don't care.
Dispatcher can take calls up to three hours in advance. Help now or later.

## Repair Program
Client will call if their wheelchair or scooter breaks.
Dispatcher lets the repair department know that someone needs something repaired.
Repair calls can take multiple trips to clients' homes.

## Equipment Loaner Program
Warehouse of loaner wheelchairs, scooters, hospital beds, walkers, shower chairs...
Can loan one of these for up to a month at NO COST.
Charge standard copay for delivery and pick up of  equipment.

IDEA: Start with the "type of service" drill down from there.

goalasos!
GOAL: The client can pay for the service through the app.
      Currently if someone doesn't have the cash on them they will be billed later for the service.
      Accepting electronic payments would make this easier.
      HARD

GOAL: Inventory tracking of items that are loaned out. Information about features of the individual items.
      EASY

GOAL: They download the app and they get some kind of information about what the service is all about.
      Like an about page I suppose.
      EASY

GOAL: The application should be easy to use both on the end user side and on the Easy Does It side.
      
GOAL: Be able to provide the location.
      MEASIUM

GOAL: Be able to provide an estimate of when a service will arrive.
      HARD

GOAL: Be able to take a picture of the thing that needs to be repaired.
      MEDIUM

GOAL: Keep track of the amount of time spent on the job. How long does it take us to provide service x?
      City of Berkeley also asks for reports on what the organization does. Ideally they want something
      that fixes the paperwork problem.
      MEDIUM.

GOAL: Tracking calls currently dispatched for each service.
      EASY.

GOAL: Allow clients to register as a new client with service and make updates to account. Customer database.
      EASY.

GOAL: In case of a disaster (e.g. the power outage recently and you're on a ventilator or have a special bed.)
      Want to keep track of a client's needs and preemptively meet them in cases of certain emergencies.
      Something like an amber alert that pops up on their phones during a disaster so they can easily contact services.
      HARD.

GOAL: Text based messaging system with clients.
      MEDIUM

GOAL: Digitally maintaining the list of attendants that a person could hire if they just lost theirs.
      EASY, mostly import issues.

GOAL: Be able to self triage and say the severity of the problem. If it's top priority, connect them directly to a 
      dispatcher. Dispatcher often contacts people via text. Should all funnel down through the dispatch.
      Dispatcher gives the contact information of the client to the attendant and the attendant gives a call to the
      client to tell them more information about when they'll be there, etc. Attendant calls dispatch at the end of
      the visit.


GOAL: Promotion of service through the app store.
